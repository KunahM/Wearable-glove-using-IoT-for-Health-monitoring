# Wearable-glove-using-IoT-for-Health-monitoring
The design of a wearable health monitoring glove using IoT is presented, the major motivation for designing such a device is the high health care costs which
keeps on increasing and also the recent technological developments in miniature biological sensors, wireless communication. The proposed system will consist
of Biological sensors, transmission modules and micro-controllers and thus can provide low cost meek solutions for real time health monitoring. 
The proposed design will have in all four biological sensors either implanted or fixed on the glove to measure different body parameters like temperature,
blood pressure and heart beat rate. Instead of using different devices for the measurements of same parameters it will be more reliable and efficient if all 
of these sensors are implanted on a single platform. The proposed device will provide real time data of a patient’s health by which premature decisions of 
symptoms and necessary steps can be considered in advance.

The proposed system is designed to provide a real-time analysis of a patient’s health. As of now, no such system with these many number of sensors has been proposed,
so it is versatile. These sensors are programmed in such a way that they should provide with accurate readings. The range of the systems varies over a wide range, 
reliable. These systems will make it easy for the patient to know their real time health status. Since this system will be available at a low cost, 
it should be affordable by as much people as it can. The proposed system will have low power consumption also the radiation emitted by the system should not affect the patient’s health. 
The proposed system has also taken into consideration medical criteria of wearability which refers to the size and weight.
